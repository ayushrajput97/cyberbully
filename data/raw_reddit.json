What was societally acceptable in the ancient era is what you are judging with present days standards.\nThat's intellectually dishonest you know. In England before the 1990s, the constitutional age of marriage for a girl is 7 and bear in mind that the judeo-Christian law was used to govern then, which was centuries before and after the existence of Prophet Muhammad PBUH. You should condemn your forefathers first. The practice was normal and acceptable in those eras, because they measure the marriageable age for a female base on physical and mental maturity. The age of marriage in those era isn't specific but ranges from 7 to 12 depending of a particular community or country.",
